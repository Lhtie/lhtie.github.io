Hi, I am Hongyi Liu (刘泓轶), a fourth year undergraduate student at [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am currently working with [Sidi Lu](http://sidilu.cn/) in UCLA [PLUS lab](https://vnpeng.net/group/) advised by Professor [Nanyun (Violet) Peng](https://vnpeng.net/). 

I have a passion for many aspects of natural language processing (NLP). My work mainly focuses on the following aspects:

- In-context learning (ICL) emergent ability of large language models
- Multitask learning and transfer learning
- Machine text generation and evaluation

Besides, I am also interested in multimodal machine learning and logical reasoning.
