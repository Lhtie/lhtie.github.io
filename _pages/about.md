Hi, I am Hongyi Liu (刘泓轶), a first year Ph.D. student at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). Before that, I was an undergraduate student at [ACM Honors Class](https://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/home), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

I have a passion for many aspects of natural language processing (NLP). My work mainly focuses on the following aspects:

- In-context learning (ICL) emergent ability of large language models
- Multitask learning and transfer learning
- Machine text generation and evaluation

Besides, I am also interested in multi-modal machine learning and logical reasoning of LMs.
